#+STARTUP: indent

* A game in the line of Choice of Games adventures

** Much more easier to tackle
** Better lisp practice
** I really liked the Choice of Games titles!

* Mechanics

** DSL for history definition/runtime
** Nice UI for the text fragments and the stats
** Scrolling text
** Buttons for different choices
** Save/restore mechanics
** Try to do it in a stylish, nice little window
** Music? Animations (UI animations, I mean)?
* Actual, Concrete plan
** UI experiments
*** Elements needed:
**** Scrollable text
**** Stats (bars)
**** Buttons for choices
**** Illustrations
*** Implementation:
**** Text
- Is the most important element and I would like to do it really beautiful
- Easy to read, nice fonts, clear colors
- With linked boxes, like Sorcery!
- Scrollable (which is probably a pain...)
- Some crude styles, like colors and bold
**** Stats
- Basically they are only bars with labels
- Nice to have: highlight the gaining/losses of the decission
**** Buttons
- Not the most important thing.
- Basic, plain buttons is enough
- With key shortcuts
**** Illustrations
- Some paragraphs can have illustrations
- Just static images, show somewher fixed
- Or maybe just as another box in the linked text fragments
**** Sounds
- Not now...
*** Steps
**** Canvas FPS test, with just full rect refresh (no conses, no other code)
***** TODO Try to achieve a solid 60FPS with minimal CPU consumption
***** Or find another way to do it (SDL?)
**** Draw a basic window layout with just color boxes
**** Think about the text movement thing
** DSL experiments
