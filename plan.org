#+STARTUP: indent

* Idea

** Clone of alien for the spectrum
** Slow, strategic game to play with sound
** Medium sized starship, and an unkown enemy wandering
** You basically can't kill the enemy, just stall it
** Have to make a plan to trhow it out or escape from the ship
** Play with multiple crew members, with some items
** The crew will not always obey your orders, based on morale and stuff
** Some crew will have strong personalities and disobey you
** You'll have a rogue member, conspiring to boicot you
** But he/she will play along until a critical event comes around
** Then he/she will fuck you plenty

* Plan/Roadmap

** Draw a window with the basic ui
** Sketch the basic game loop and code structure

* Technical challenges

** Just the basic game structure is challenging enough..
** Same with the racket UI drawing/updating
** But the emphasis here is to use only persistent data structures
** And keep the code as purely functional as possible
